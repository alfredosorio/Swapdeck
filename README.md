# Swapdeck
Collector Card Trading Site

# Concept

I started this website in Ruby on Rails, after doing some initial mockups and a trello board to plan out sections and what I would need to add to the website.

It is a card collector's trading website, where users can either buy, swap or sell their duplicate cards with other users.

The initial plan was to include a section of the site with a profile page that allowed users to view the card in collections they already owned and which cards from their collections they still needed to collect. They would be able to view a page that showed the whole collection and click on the cards in that collection they already had, and it would then let them see which cards they still needed to collect to get the whole collection. - this feature will be added later.

## Other features not yet implemented:

A listings page - to allow users to add cards for trade.

Full bootstrap integration - to include sitewide "look and feel" and navigation.

User profile page - to be added later.

Recent Uploads - this would have showed recent uploaded cards from users who have cards to trade on the front page of the website and will hopefully be added at a later date.

Deploy to Heroku/Similar: I didn't get around to doing this.

# Explanation:

I didn't get around to implementing the full website as I would have liked because I got sick with a cold that turned into a reaction to meds I have to take. Hopefully I'll get a chance to fix this website so that it is fully functional.
